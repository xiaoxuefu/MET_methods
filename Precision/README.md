MET_fig2_create_gaze_heatmaps.m loads .txt files containing gaze information and MET scene camera resolution. It calls MET_gaze_heatmap.m that generates heatmaps from the input gaze data and calcuate root mean squared error (RMSE) of distances to the center of all gaze points and to the center of the scene video. 

The input data are generated by the Positive Science eye tracker. A comparable tool for gaze data recorded using PUPIL eye tracker is provided in [et_tools](https://github.com/xiaoxuefu/et_tools).
