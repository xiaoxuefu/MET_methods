# Gaze Coding Error Tolerance

Run MET_fig2_get_error_angle_of_bullseye.m: It calls MET_visual_angle_error_calculator.m to compute the degrees of visual angle of the circles in a bullseye used for manual gaze coding. 

**User-specified inputs**: 
* The scene camera field of view (FOV) x (horizontal) and y (vertical) in degrees and pixels. These are provided by the eye tracker manufacturer. 
* The radius of each cicle in the bullseye - the distance from the center to the edge of the circle in pixels.
